# DVF Data Analysis
[The Jupyter Notebook](https://albanecoiffe.github.io/DVF_Projet/)

This project aims to analyze the Demandes de Valeurs Fonci√®res (DVF) dataset, which includes real estate transactions in France during 2022, excluding Alsace, Moselle, and Mayotte. These data, derived from notarial deeds and cadastral information, are publicly available on data.gouv.fr.

The goal of this project is to explore and model real estate transactions using machine learning techniques, starting with data preparation and exploratory data analysis (EDA). We then applied unsupervised learning algorithms to identify clusters, followed by a supervised model to predict apartment prices in specific regions.

## üìä Project Phases
- Data Preparation: Cleaning, merging, selecting, and transforming data for analysis.
- Exploratory Analysis: Examining key variables influencing real estate prices and creating visualizations (histograms, geographic maps, correlation matrices).
- Modeling:
  - Unsupervised Learning: Segmenting data using clustering techniques.
  - Supervised Learning: Developing a predictive model to estimate property prices.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
- Python: Main programming language.
- Pandas: Data manipulation and processing.
- Matplotlib: Additional data visualization.
- Scikit-learn (sklearn): Machine learning algorithms, including clustering and regression.
- Jupyter Notebook: Interactive environment for data analysis and modeling.
